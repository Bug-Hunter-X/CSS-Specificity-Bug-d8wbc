# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS: unexpected styling behavior caused by conflicting styles with the same specificity.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code, showcasing the unexpected override. The `bugSolution.css` file shows how to fix it, using more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (use cautiously).
